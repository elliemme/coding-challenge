## Project Description

You need to build a web application that allows users to view and filter a list of movies. Users should be able to search for movies by title and filter the movies by genre, rating, and release date. The application should also allow users to create an account, log in, and save movies to a watchlist.

## Requirements

### Frontend

- The frontend should be built using React.
- The user interface should be responsive and work on different screen sizes.
- The application should use a state management library like Redux or Context API.
- The movie list should be retrieved from the backend and displayed on the frontend.
- Users should be able to filter the movie list by genre, rating, and release date.
- Users should be able to search for movies by title.
- Users should be able to create an account, log in, and save movies to a watchlist.

### Backend

- The backend should be built using Node.js and Express.
- The backend should provide a RESTful API to communicate with the frontend.
- The backend should use a database like MongoDB to store user accounts and watchlists.
- The backend should retrieve the movie list from an external API like [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) or [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
- The backend should provide endpoints for user registration, login, and watchlist management.

## Evaluation Criteria
